《且听风吟》（林少华译本），村上春树，一九七九：
> 关于好的文章，哈特费尔德这样写道：
> 
> 「从事写文章这一作业，首先要确认自己同周遭事物之间的距离，所需要的不是感性，而是**尺度**。」（《心情愉悦有何不好》，一九三六年）
> 
> 于是我一手拿尺，开始惶惶不安地张望周围的世界。
> 
> ……我在记事簿的正中划一条直线，左侧记载所得，右侧则写所失——失却的、毁掉的、早已抛弃的、付诸牺牲的、辜负的……但我没有坚持写到最后。
> 
> ……我们要力图认识的对象和实际认识的对象之间，总是横陈着一道深渊，无论用怎样长的尺都无法完全测量其深度。我这里所能够书写出来的，不过是一览表而已。既非小说、文学，又不是艺术，只是正中画有一条直线的一本记事簿。若说教训，倒也许多少有一点。

[ChineNoire](http://www.chinenoire.com/cosmos17/ChineNoire.html)，曹志涟:
> 我非常懷念未來；如此懷念，我已經在為它寫作。

[*Modern boys and mobile girls*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/apr/01/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.features), William Gibson, 2001:
> The otaku, the passionate obsessive, the information age's embodiment of the connoisseur, more concerned with the accumulation of data than of objects \[…\] Understanding otaku -hood, I think, is one of the keys to understanding the culture of the web. There is something profoundly post-national about it, extra-geographic. We are all curators, in the post-modern world, whether we want to be or not.

*VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action*, Sukeban Games, 2016:
> A city that shouldn’t exist. A tax haven where corporations and criminal empires reign supreme.
> 
> In this place, all human life has been infected with nanomachines to keep them in check. Over them stand the White Knights, who ensure that a corrupt government’s laws are obeyed.
> 
> Here, brutality in all its forms is an everyday reality. The quality of life for the non-powerful decreases at an alarming rate.
> 
> For many, this can be overwhelming. Some devote themselves to their jobs, their families, or even their studies. Some look for ways to escape this place, and others… just give up.
> 
> But for many of them,  the answer lies at the bottom of a glass.

[Punk subculture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture):
> The punk ethos is primarily made up of beliefs such as non-conformity, anti-authoritarianism, anti-corporatism, a do-it-yourself ethic, anti-consumerist, anti-corporate greed, direct action, and not “selling out”.
> 
> Women in the hardcore scene typically wore clothing categorized as masculine.
