来自 Caroline Shaw 的[《八声部组曲》](https://roomfulofteeth.bandcamp.com/album/partita-for-8-voices-caroline-shaw)。我想这是当代音乐图景当中对我来说最美妙的部分之一。人声可以伸展到如此宽阔的地域。只有在「当代古典」中才会出现的奇妙和声，木洞一般空旷又绵密的质感。（已经有点难以形容了，暂时写不出）总之，我感觉到其中的某些东西强烈地吸引着我。

> Partita for 8 Voices is an a cappella composition by American composer Caroline Shaw. It was composed from 2009 through 2012 for the vocal group Roomful of Teeth and was released on their Grammy Award-winning self-titled debut album on 30 October 2012. The piece was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music on 15 April 2013, making Shaw the youngest recipient of the award.
